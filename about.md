# What are egalitarian systems?

Societies are usually held together by ***systems***. Political and economic systems determine the wellbeing of a country.

An **egalitarian system** is any kind of system that operates with the belief that **all people are equal**. Policies and activities are conducted with this understanding in mind.

## Egalitarian political systems

Political organizations that govern according to what is best for **everyone**, domestically and internationally. These administrations listen to their citizens, allocate resources to their concerns, and implement policies that make for a more wholesome country.

These organizations protect rights for each group represented, and facilitate efforts to improve the lives of every group based on an objective ethical standard.

## Egalitarian market systems

Companies and organizations within an economy that conduct business with ***intentional integrity***. They hold themselves to high standards and lead their respective industries to a "race to the top"â€”better outcomes for society, the environment, workers, organizations, and government.
