# Equitable Market Systems (EQM)

Equitable Market Systems (EQM) is an incubator for profitable, non-profit, political, and environmental startups. 

In lieu of capital and investors, our team is staffed by equity laborersâ€”individuals who build new companies prior to pay, and are paid retroactively once the company is profitable. 

EQM intends to staff every role in a traditional company via equity labor to maximize the success of our first wave of entrepreneurial projects, then hire individuals with salaries once our first profitable endeavors are successful.

## Social Businesses

Many of EQM's profitable startups are considered **Social Businesses.** These companies compensate leadership and workers well, then allocate remaining earnings to launch new businesses of any size, pay taxes, and fund nonprofit and social-maximizing companies. 

## Proprietary Businesses

Proprietary companies are built with support from EQM teams and/or resources at a nominal cost, in exchange for the company's adherence to [egalitarian standards](#egalitarian-economic-systems). The owner(s) maintain their stake indefinitely after their contributions are complete.

EQM's administrative team is tasked with reducing risk and improving the probability of success, to all but ensure that everyone's collective efforts are rewarded.


# What are egalitarian systems?

Societies are usually held together by **systems**. Political and economic systems determine the wellbeing of a country.

An **egalitarian system** is any kind of system that operates with the belief that **all people are equal**. Policies and activities are conducted with this understanding in mind.

## Egalitarian political systems

Any political organization that governs based on what is best for **everyone**, using [objective ethics](#objective-ethics) as a standard.

In addition to governing responsibly, these administrations listen to their citizens, allocate resources to their concerns, and implement ethical policies to form and maintain a wholesome country.

In an egalitarian political system, organizations protect the rights and improve the lives of **every group represented**. If you are alive, you are considered valuable. 

## Egalitarian economic systems

An egalitarian market system is a collection of companies and organizations who conduct business in any industry with **intentional integrity**. They hold themselves to high standards and lead their respective industries to a "race to the top": wholesome outcomes for society, the environment, workers, organizations, and government.

At a high level, egalitarian market activity includes: 

- removing barriers for workers to achieve their desired careers, 
- paying people for the value they bring to the company instead of the often underwhelming "market rate", and 
- maintaining healthy corporate cultures with work/life balance.



# Objective ethics

In its simplest form, **objective ethics** is concerned with how to act in the best interest of one's self, as well as other individuals and groups. 

It is possible to determine what is **objectively ethical** based on projected and actual outcomes that decisions have others.

For every company and facet of government, there are ethical ways to operate. With intentionality, we can create policies that keep everyone's best interest in mind.
