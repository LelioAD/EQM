# What are egalitarian systems?

Societies are usually held together by **systems**. Political and economic systems determine the wellbeing of a country.

An **egalitarian system** is any kind of system that operates with the belief that **all people are equal**. Policies and activities are conducted with this understanding in mind.

## Egalitarian political systems

Any political organization that governs based on what is best for **everyone**, using objective ethics as a standard.

In addition to governing responsibly, these administrations listen to their citizens, allocate resources to their concerns, and implement ethical policies to form and maintain a wholesome country.

In an egalitarian political system, organizations protect the rights and improve the lives of **every group represented**. If you are alive, you are considered valuable. 

## Egalitarian market systems

An egalitarian market system is a collection of companies and organizations who conduct business in any industry with **intentional integrity**. They hold themselves to high standards and lead their respective industries to a "race to the top": wholesome outcomes for society, the environment, workers, organizations, and government.

At a high level, egalitarian market activity includes: 

- removing barriers for workers to achieve their desired careers, 
- paying people for the value they bring to the company instead of the often underwhelming "market rate", and 
- maintaining healthy corporate cultures with work/life balance.


# Equitable Market Systems (EQM)

Equitable Market Systems (EQM) is a startup group of entrepreneurs for every role in a traditional company. We build competitive organizations with or without investors. 

While EQM is a for-profit organization, our first endeavor is non-profit: building a political party system for Americans who do not have a political party that represents them or acts on their values.

## Corporate model

Entrepreneurs often build products or services without capital, investing their own resources to create something of value, while retaining ownership of that project. 

EQM takes the entrepreneurial model a step further by enlisting a full team to develop projects from scratch to launch. Team contributions are tracked, and members receive pay once the company earns revenue.

Once operating costs are covered, team members receive up to 3x their respective role's "egalitarian market rate" in scale with the company's financial success. EQM uses the remaining revenue to fund future businesses that can afford to pay workers from day one while following the same reward structure.

**Socially owned** comapnies compensate leadership and workers accordingly, then allocate the remaining earnings to fund new businesses of any size, as well as socially beneficial projects, such as research and development for scientific breakthroughs. 

**Proprietary** companies are built using EQM teams and/or resources. The owner(s) continues to receive residuals for developing the idea after their contributions are complete.

EQM's administrative team is tasked with reducing risk and improving the probability of success, to all but ensure that everyone's collective efforts are rewarded.

# Objective ethics

In its simplest form, **objective ethics** is concerned with how to act in the best interest of one's self, as well as other individuals and groups. 

It is possible to determine what is **objectively ethical** based on projected and actual outcomes that decisions have others.

For every company and facet of government, there are ethical ways to operate. With intentionality, we can create policies that keep everyone's best interest in mind.
