# The path to a national, multilateral political alliance: 

## 1. Identify the new majority.

The new majority is **conscious, informed** to varying degrees, **ethical,** and sees themselves and others as **equals**. We can regard this new majority as **humanitarians.**

While we may not agree with everything, we have enough in common to form a new majority and move the country *forward*—before it regresses for four more years.

## 2. Form a team to facilitate the party.

Modern presidential candidates usually spend over $100 million on election staffing and campaigns. This creates a barrier for entry in many cases.

The urgency of the 2024 election season is enough to warrant volunteers in the absence of a fully funded campaign team, while other teams building profitable projects that, once profitable, can pay the political administration retroactively.

Through organized efforts, we can work together online and in person, launch marketing campaigns through social media and other mediums, and engage with voters in-person in every county.

## 3. Discuss, choose policies.

Certain rights must be protected. Humanitarianism only works when every group and individual has equal rights at the human level. We can call these **Secured Rights.** Any new policies introduced must not violate these secured rights.

Next to Secured Rights, citizens and ethical thought leaders discuss and **vote on policies** that cover every aspect of government, from domestic to foreign policy.

This is where we get the country we deserve, instead of the "lesser evil": rights protected, funds allocated to society's growth, and actions taken to improve quality of life in education, healthcare, career, peace policies, prison reform, and climate change, to name a few.

## 4. Identify candidates.

Humanitarian politicians are those who understand what society wants and deserves, and take action to realize these ideals. They articulate citizens' desires for the countrym and act by introducing and approving corresponding bills.

Ideally, the political alliance should have the ability to **impeach and replace its own candidates** should they vote astray from the outlined policies. Party legal consultants can confirm how to achieve this. 

Existing politicians may be able to run on the egalitarian ballot, provided that they have a track record for humanitarianism, adhere to our desired policies, and do not act outside of the supermajority's interests.

## 5. Vote for the country you desire.

Once society and candidates are aligned on what we want, we make our desires into reality by showing up in large numbers at the polls.
