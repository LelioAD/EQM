# The path to an egalitarian political party: 

## 1. Identify the new majority.

The new majority is **conscious, informed** to varying degrees, **ethical,** and sees themselves and others as **equal**. Let's call ourselves **egalitarians.**

While we may not agree with everything, we have enough in common to form a new majority and move the country *forward*.

## 2. Form an organization to facilitate the party.

Modern presidential candidates usually spend over $100 million on election staffing and campaigns. This creates a barrier for entry in many cases.

The urgency of the 2024 election season is enough to warrant volunteers in the absence of a fully funded campaign team.

Through organized efforts, we can work together from home, launch unpaid marketing campaigns through social media, and engage with voters in-person in every county.

## 3. Discuss, choose policies.

Certain rights must be protected. Egalitarianism only works when every group and individual has equal rights at the human level. We can call these **Secured Rights.** Any new policies introduced must not violate these secured rights.

Next to Secured Rights, citizens and ethical thought leaders discuss and **vote on policies** that cover every aspect of government, from domestic to foreign policy.

This is where we get the country we deserve, instead of the "lesser evil": rights protected, funds allocated to society's growth, and actions taken to improve quality of life in education, healthcare, career, peace policies, prison reform, and climate change, to name a few.

## 4. Identify candidates.

Egalitarian politicians are those who digest what society wants and reflect this in words and deed. They can articulate citizen's desires for the country and act by introducing and approving bills.

Ideally the egalitarian party should have the ability to **impeach and replace its own candidates** should they vote astray from the outlined policies. Party consultants can confirm whether this is possible. 

In some cases, existing politicians may be able to run on the egalitarian ballot, provided that they adhere to our desired policies and do not act outside of egalitarian interests.

## 5. Vote for the country you desire.

Once society and candidates are aligned on what we want, we make our desires into reality by showing up in large numbers at the polls.
