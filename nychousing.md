title: NYC Housing Subsidies Project
subtitle: Connecting homeless New Yorkers to housing more efficiently and effectively.
---

The NYC Housing Subsidies Project helps CityFHEPS, Homebase, and Supportive Housing applicants obtain housing through three initiatives (below). Successful implementation will help New Yorkers afford to live in NYC, while providing landlords with guaranteed income.

### Organizational Efficiency

A Human Resources consultant meets with housing agencies to asses needs. Add the necessary team members to understaffed departments.

Update IT systems to better handle load of clients. This will significantly reduce the time for agencies to process housing applications.

### Housing Readiness

Matriculate unsheltered citizens to shelters. Prepare them for Single Room Occupancy housing.

Work with shelters and nonprofits to help applicants keep their apartments through training: cooking, budgeting, employment, etc. 

### Matchmaking Campaign

Create a database to match CityFHEPS & Supportive Housing recipients to vacant properties. 

Campaign for landlords to join the housing database. Advertise the new streamlined processing times, guaranteed income, and housing ready applicants.
